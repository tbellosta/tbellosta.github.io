Tracking particles in fluid flows is an important step in simulations dealing with multiphase processes. In Computational Fluid Dynamics particle tracking is used for different applications, such as streamlines tracing and the simulation of particle laden flows. 

In in-flight ice accretion simulations, particle tracking is used to solve the water droplets field in the particle laden flow of droplets and air around aircrafts. It's main goal is to compute the so-called collection efficiency, which relates the mass of water collected at a given location on a surface to freestream conditions (i.e. Velocity, liquid water content and time of exposure to wet conditions). 

Particle traking is therefore an important block of every ice accretion simulation code.

In my research I have dealt with the implemetation of both Lagrangian and Eulerian particle tracking codes. 

In the Lagrangian frame of reference the trajectories of groups of particles of similar properties called parcels, are computed directly by solving an ODE (Newton's second law). This allows for a straightforward modeling of physical phenomena such as aerodynamic breakup, droplet deformation, and droplet-wall interaction. This task is embarassingly parallel, in the code this is exploited by using an hybrid MPI-OpenMP parallelization. 
The picture below shows one of the features of the Lagrangin particle tracking code, which is that of working with sliding and deforming meshes. Here particles are tracked across an helicopter rotor in hover. The rotor is embedded in a cylindrical mesh that is moving inside a larger still mesh.
